    "Measures of dispersion, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, are used to describe the spread or variability of a dataset. Here's how each measure is used:\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Variance: The variance measures the average squared difference of each value from the mean. It provides a more precise measure of the spread of the data compared to the range. However, it is not in the original units of the data, making it less interpretable.\n",

    "1. **Measures of Central Tendency:**\n",
    "   - Mean: Outliers can pull the mean towards them, especially in smaller datasets. This happens because the mean is sensitive to extreme values.\n",

    "   - Mode: Outliers do not affect the mode since it is simply the most frequent value in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Measures of Dispersion:**\n",
    "   - Range: Outliers can increase the range significantly, especially if they are far from the rest of the data.\n",
    "   - Variance and Standard Deviation: Outliers can inflate the variance and standard deviation, as these measures consider the distance of each data point from the mean.\n",
    "   - Interquartile Range (IQR): Outliers can affect the IQR, but to a lesser extent compared to the range, variance, and standard deviation, as it is based on the quartiles.\n",

    "- Mode: The mode remains undefined since no value appears more than once.\n",
